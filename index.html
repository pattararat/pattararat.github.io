    <p>  7/31 was the first day of school we didn't really do anything much, the most fun part was at the end of the day bc we got to play game and I kinda eaten that up.</p>
    <p> but the second day tho, i got to know some friends that really do have things in common and we've become frined since then</p>
    <p> also on thursday we got to go to play an escape room, unfortuenly we didn't get to choose who we wanted to be with but it was still a pretty good experience. </p>

    <p> Finally, the last day of school has come and then I realized that my freinds and I won't be having the same class anymore.</p>
    <p> throughout the summer class, we've been working a game that will be played by other group of students on the last day, so we ended palying games together, presented our game and having fun as it's the last day of summer school.</p>
